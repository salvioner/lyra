1) Edit file config.py to fit your computer's configuration.



2) Package requirements for alg.py:

vaderSentiment
numpy
glob
json



3) Package requirements for dboperations.py:

numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
sklearn.cluster
glob



4) For help, run:

python start.py -h

from the root folder (where this file is saved). I suggest the use of
Anaconda distribution of Python, which includes almost all the required packages.
